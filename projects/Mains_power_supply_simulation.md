<h2>Introduction</h2>
Many times I saw my self trying to power electricals only to realize that I don't own a suitable power supply. A variable voltage output PSU is (in my opinion) one of the most valuable assets for an electrical engineer, and a working on such a project is well worth it in the long run. A high current capability, as well as a variable output Voltage, will allow me to power most equipment that I will be working on. However, mains voltages are dangerous and designing a mains power supply requires experience and understanding of safety regulations. Therefore, at this early stage I have only worked on a virtual design and only after checking my designs with experienced professionals I will move onto a physical implementation. 

<h2>System design</h2>
The power supply will be designed to meet the following specifications:

Input: 230 VAC
Output: 12-60V DC
Max power: 800W
Output voltage ripple: 800mV
Topology: Full-bridge

I have used a transformer obtained from a scrapped power supply, which has a
